Summary
---------

I worked as a backend developer for 8++ years. <br>
The main language I used is php. I worked in web server environment using various languages such as php, golang, dart etc. <br>
I have designed it to receive a lot of traffic (applications, databases, etc.). <br>
In the frontend side, I used a flutter to deal with a lot of toy projects. <br>
I am interested in the open source project and community.
